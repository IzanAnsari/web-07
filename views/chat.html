        <h3>Chat with your friends</h3>
        <p>
            I developed a Group Chat application that enables users to communicate in real-time, fostering seamless collaboration
            and communication within a group. The app is built using Express.js, Node.js, EJS, CSS, and JavaScript. Real-time
            communication is made possible by leveraging Socket.io, providing users with instant messaging capabilities.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The app allows users to register and log in securely, creating a personalized experience for each participant. Once
            logged in, users can access the main chat interface, where they can exchange messages with other members of the group.
            Socket.io ensures that messages are delivered instantly, facilitating smooth and uninterrupted communication.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            For a better user experience, the chat messages are displayed in an organized and easily readable format. Additionally,
            users have the ability to view the active participants in the chat, enhancing transparency and engagement within the
            group.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To further enhance the app's utility, I implemented the option to create multiple chat rooms. Users can switch between
            different chat rooms based on their interests or project teams, making the app versatile and accommodating diverse
            communication needs.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As a security measure, the app implements user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only registered and
            logged-in users can access the chat rooms. This guarantees a safe and private communication environment for all
            participants.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To deploy the app and manage client-server communication efficiently, I employed Nginx as a reverse proxy server,
            optimizing performance and scalability. The app is hosted on AWS EC2, providing high availability and accessibility
            to users at any time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Overall, this Group Chat application exemplifies my expertise in web development, real-time communication
            integration using Socket.io, and deployment on a scalable infrastructure. Its interactive and user-friendly features.
